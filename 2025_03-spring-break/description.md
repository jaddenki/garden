this was a pretty eventful spring break<br><br>
it started with the [c3 game jam](https://www.jadden.xyz/projects/game-jam),<br>
then i flew to sf to visit with and meet some friends,<br>
and we took a 12hr amtrak to la!<br><br>
super fun trip, would do again <3<br>
here are some of my fav shots, from my sony cybershot!
